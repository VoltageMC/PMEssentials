## API:
**PMEssentials** has an API for developers can tweak a lot of features and improve them. You can access the UserMap to get users and externally enable things like godmode or vanish. The plugin also has quite a few events you can use to for instance modify command behaviour.

If you want to get the API instance, all you need to do is this:
```php
$api = API::getAPI();
```
You can get the main file too, but you probably won't need it.

Now, let's say you're creating a command and you want it to work on vanished platers. You can use these functions:
```php
//get ALL vanished players
$vplayers = $api->getVanishedPlayers();

//get vanished player from name
$vplayer = $api->getVanishedPlayer("myplayer");
```
If you want something changed in the API you can always open an issue with the API request template.
